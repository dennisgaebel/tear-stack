# The TEAR Stack

Welcome to the shortest stack out there. This stack combines TailwindCSS, Eleventy, AlpineJS, and Rollup to make static site authoring easy and minimal! Built upon the shoulders of [TEA Stack by Matt Waler](https://github.com/mattwaler/tea-stack).

## Getting Started

Just run the usual commands and peep the `package.json` file to see the available scripts and packages.

For the lazy:

- `npm i` to build that big ol' `node_modules` folder
- `npm start` to boot up that dev server and start building
- `npm run build` when you're ready to build a production bundle

**Bonus**
`npm run build && npx serve dist` will boot up a local server of your production site!

## Recommended VS Code Extensions

A short list of extensions for VS Code that make working with this template even more awesome!
