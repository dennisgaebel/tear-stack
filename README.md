# The TEA Stack

Welcome to the shortest stack out there. This stack combines TailwindCSS, Eleventy, and AlpineJS to make static site authoring easy and minimal!

## Getting Started

Just run the usual commands and peep the `package.json` file to see the available scripts and packages.

For the lazy:

- `npm i` to build that big ol' `node_modules` folder
- `npm start` to boot up that dev server and start building
- `npm run build` when you're ready to build a production bundle

**Bonus**
`npm run build && npx serve dist` will boot up a local server of your production site!

## Recommended VS Code Extensions

A short list of extensions for VS Code (my primary editor) that make working with this template even more awesome!

- Nunjucks Template by eseom
- TailwindCSS Intellisense
